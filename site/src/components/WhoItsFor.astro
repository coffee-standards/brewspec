const toolBuilderBody = `<p>Building a brew logger, a roasting app, or a recipe platform? BrewSpec is a shared format you can build against instead of defining your own. JSON Schema-validated. Version-controlled with documented migration paths between versions. Apache 2.0 — use it in anything.</p>
<p>The schema lives at <a href="https://brewspec.org/schema/v0.4.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brewspec.org/schema/v0.4.json</a>. The spec document covers every field, validation rules, and the expected validation pipeline.</p>`;

const coffeeProBody = `<p>If you log brews — on paper, in a spreadsheet, in an app — BrewSpec is the format your data can travel in. Export from one tool, import into another. No locked-in proprietary format.</p>
<p>BrewLog is the reference CLI implementation. Free, local, no account required. Log a brew in under a minute. Your data is yours.</p>`;
